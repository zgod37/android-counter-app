## Overview

A simple tally counter application for Android devices.  The app can keep track of up to 10 counters at a time.  Each counter features adjustable increment/decrement step values, and can be customized with different background colors and labels for easy distinction.  Can be used as a scorecard for your favorite card/board game, a pitch counter for pitchers in baseball games, keeping track of inventory, or whatever!
